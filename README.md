1. Ethical Issues (Potential violations)
These problems could arise based off the fact that the messages can be anything. Depending on how this data is manipulated, stored, sent, recieved, etc. there is obviouus potential of exploitation and misconduct. Best way to prevent this is to store as little info as possible and if things must be stored, only keep the absolute minimum required.
      1. Privacy
      2. Confidentiality 
      3. Trust in the developer
      
2. Legal Issues(potential violations)

Due to the fact that nearly every countries laws based around applications, data, privacy, etc. are all different these potential issues vary from country to country. I will specifically mention potetntial legal issues involving China. China has requirments for which software creators must follow and comply with. The software must first be certified by the government and the software must follow specific sets of data privacy laws. The potential for legal issues arise from the different specifications among different regions of china such as hong kong. With the messages being custom and peer to peer communication there could be a gray area with data privacy depending on how the messages are stored, if they are stored at all. There is also the legal issue of who the users of the app may communicate with, example: communications with users of the app that outside of the country. These other users may not have the same restrictions and therefore may do or say something which conflicts with laws of the users countries.
      1. Improper Certifications/Compliance
      2. Data Privacy
      3. Region specific requirments
 
3. Professional Issues(potential issues) With my area being specifically China there are potentially questionable rules and regulations that must be followed in order to allow the applications use in the country. These rules and regulations could violate high ethical standards and ensuring public good and saftey as the centeral concern. The contraversial standards and rules of the chinease government could potentially violate these professionals ethical responsibilites and obligations.
      1. Maintaining high standards especially ethical
      2. ensure public good is central concern
      3. Using care when modifyin or retiring systems
